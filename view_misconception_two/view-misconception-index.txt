Hia, my name is Curtis and I have a problem. My friends keep telling me that if they make their speaker volume higher, then it'll drain their battery faster. However I've heard that Transformers inside the device don't increase battery usage. Halp!n!
15!n!~robford~~kshen~!n!~billgates~!n!splacorne!n!HI okay first of all, you need to work on your grammer ("halp isn't a word").anyways it is true that turning up the volume increases battery usage. THis is because it requires more energy to make it louder. However, it uses so much that there is basically "no increase in battery usage" Hope this helps!
