I've heard that plants take in carbon dioxide to make food. But I've also heard that they "exhale" it too??? can someone please clear this up?!n!
50!n!~cur123~.!f!.!n!.!n!splacorn!n!Yes they do. \-n\-nIt is well known that plants give off oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis. However plants need to burn up sugar to release its energy. This process; known as cellular respiration, has a by product of carbon dioxide.\-n\-nPlants will release carbon dioxide during the day, but one thing that people don't realize is that during the night there isn't any sunlight for photosynthesis so they will only release carbon dioxide, and no oxygen as photosynthesis isn't happening.\-n\-n<span style="color: #EDEDED;">_______________</span>Here are some links you can check out:\-n\-n<span style="color: #EDEDED;">_______________</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis\-n<span style="color: #EDEDED;">_______________</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration!n!0!c!.!f!.!c!cur123!c!Great answer! I didn't know that!r!0!r!.!r!splacorn!r!Thanks. Glad to help!r!!c!1!c!~splacorntwo~.!f!.!c!splacorntwo!c!Keep in mind that despite the fact that they emit carbon dioxide, they produce more oxygen than they release carbon dioxide, so plants such as trees are used to remove carbon dioxide from the air!r!
-1!n!.!f!.!n!~cur123~.!n!cur123!n!No, Plants don't release carbon dioxide. They only release oxygen!n!0!c!.!f!.!c!Splacorn!c!Actually that's incorrect. Check out my answer!!r!
